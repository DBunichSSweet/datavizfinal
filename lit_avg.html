        <p>The data source we pulled from averaged their literacy rates according to the percentage of people in those states that fall into three levels: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The higher a person’s level, the more literate they are. These are individually not important to our conclusion, but we think it’s still important to visualize how the average works. This dashboard shows the maps for all three levels as well as restating the average rates.</p>
