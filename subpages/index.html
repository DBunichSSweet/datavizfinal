        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            Literacy rates should in theory show correlation with employment, but 
            it is not always evident that this corresponds to GDP. Our maps aim to visualize
            GDP per capita and literacy rates across all 50 states. Literacy data was sourced from 
            <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/">The National Center for Education Standards</a> and GDP data was sourced from <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/histdatacore/HistFileDetails.html?HistCateID=1&FileGroupID=308"> The Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.
            Please note that our data is limited to 2017, so the statewide literacy rates and GDP per capita stats may not be reflective of the modern-day trends (2025).
            However, given that these are the most recent datasets provided by government sources, we are still confident in the effectiveness of their implications.

            <p>Economic and tourist powerhouses like Texas, California, and New York show a low correlation stemming from a low literacy rate with a high GDP per capita. They are perhaps the most evident counter to our initial assumption that a higher literacy rate leads to higher GDP. On the other hand, oil powerhouses like Alaska and North Dakota show a high correlation stemming from consistently higher stats. There’s also a higher overall correlation in the eastern and southeastern United States. While there are other low-correlation areas to consider, the key takeaway is that a higher GDP per capita does not always come from a high literacy rate. Thus, we challenge the initial assumption and believe there should be a reframing of how the general public thinks about GDP in relation to statewide education. Though the tourist powerhouses generate a lot of GDP due to a surplus of people and skilled workers, the states themselves are less literate than others.</p>
